            <h2>Why us?</h2>
            <p>Very often God gives a man a nice appearance. But the man’s heart becomes coarse apart of this generous gift. Beauty is not the same as inner world. An external ugliness can hide a heart, which holds love to the whole world without any borders. The author of this story introduces such a human to us. His name is Phillip. He has a hunchback with mutilated limbs. The man lives in a quite location. He is an artist. He paints the pictures of nature. Especially he likes painting birds. He learned all of them.</p>

            <h2>Quality-Safety-Confidence</h2>
            <p>Uther Pendragon made his guests very welcome and it seemed that there would soon be peace between the king and the duke. Unfortunately, the king fell in love with the duke's wife. He told her that he was in love with her and asked her to betray her husband. Igraine was very angry with Uther Pendragon because she was in love with her husband.</p>

            <h2>Buy it</h2>
            <p>'The king wants to dishonour me,' she told the duke. 'I think we should return to our own castle where we will be safe from him.'

The duke followed his wife's advice and they left Uther Pendragon's palace secretly. When the king learned that his guests had left so secretly, he was furious. He called his advisers together and asked them what he should do.

'Send a message to the Duke of Cornwall and order him to come back,' one of the advisers suggested. 'If he refuses, you must take an army and attack him.'</p>

        <dt>We are the best in our business because...</dt>
            <dd>... i had been riding all day and it was now late. The pale sun was low in the sky when I arrived at the House of Usher.

A large lake of black water surrounded the house. I stopped by the lake and looked at the house. Roderick Usher's house was a large black building. Its many windows were like empty eyes. Suddenly, I felt cold...and a little afraid.</dd>
        <dt>And again</dt>
            <dd>In front of me, a narrow road went across a bridge toward the house. I walked my horse along the narrow road until I reached the walls of the house.

I knocked on the front door and a servant opened it. He took my horse to a stable. Then he led me inside the house.

We climbed many stairs to his master's room. Lamps burned along the walls, but they gave little light. The long corridors and stairways were full of dark shadows.

The servant opened a big, wooden door and I looked inside a large room.</dd>
