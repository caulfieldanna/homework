		<h2>DOOR HANDLES</h2>
		<h3>Pay attention</h3>
		<p>Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is this 
school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You 
probably heard of it. 
You've probably seen 
the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some 
hotshot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was 
play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place. And 
underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: "Since 1888 we have been 
molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men." Strictly for the birds. They don't 
do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn't know 
anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that 
many. And they probably came to Pencey that way. </p>

	<h3>Why should you choose us?</h3>
	<p>The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, 
was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the goddam 
manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We'd gone in to New York that morning for 
this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn't have the meet. I left all the 
foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It wasn't all my fault. I had to keep 
getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get off. So we got back to Pencey 
around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime. The whole team ostracized me the whole 
way back on the train. It was pretty funny, in a way. </p>
	<blockquote>The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say 
good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher. He
 had the grippe, and I figured I probably 
wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started. He wrote me this note saying he 
wanted to see me before I went home. He knew I wasn't coming back to Pencey. </blockquote>
	
	<h3>Why are we the best?</h3>
	<p>Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on 
top of that stupid hill. I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything. The week 
before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur-
lined gloves right in the pocket and all. Pencey was full of crooks. Quite a few guys came 
from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway. The more expensive a 
school is, the more crooks it has--I'm not kidding. Anyway, I kept standing next to that 
crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off. Only, I wasn't watching 
the game too much.</p>
