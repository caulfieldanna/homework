				<p>They each had their own room and all. They were both around seventy years old, 
or even more than that. They got a bang out of things, though--in a haif-assed way, of 
course. I know that sounds mean to say, but I don't mean it mean. I just mean that I used 
to think about old Spencer quite a lot, and if you thought about him too much, you 
wondered what the heck he was still living for. I mean he was all stooped over, and he 
had very terrible posture, and in class, whenever he dropped a piece of chalk at the 
blackboard, some guy in the first row always had to get up and pick it up and hand it to 
him. That's awful, in my opinion. But if you thought about him just enough and not too 
much, you could figure it out that he wasn't 
doing too bad for himself. For instance, one 
Sunday when some other guys and I were over there for hot chocolate, he showed us this 
old beat-up Navajo blanket that he and 
Mrs. Spencer'd bought off some Indian in 
Yellowstone Park. You could tell old Spencer
'd got a big bang out of buying it. That's 
what I mean. You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big 
bang out of buying a blanket. </p>

				<p>Old Spencer started nodding again. He also started picking his nose. He made out 
like he was only pinching it, but he was really getting the old thumb right in there. I guess 
he thought it was all right to do because it was only me that was in the room. I didn't care, 
except that it's pretty disgusting to watch somebody pick their nose. 
Then he said, "I had the privilege of meeting your mother and dad when they had 
their little chat with Dr. Thurmer some weeks ago. They're grand people." </p>
